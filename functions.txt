Anything not inside of the function starter text and the function ending text is ignored
(in this case the start and ending texts are the greater and less than signs).
Use ASCII chars.

(function start text) (function name) (function vars) = (function body) (function end text)
No spaces in function name, but spaces to seperate the stuff and spaces in between vars and spaces inside the function body.

> avg2 x y = x y + 2 / <
//
use this first one like:
1 5 avg2
and it becomes
1 5 + 2 /

Vars can be skipped (but the name and body should not be skipped).
> PI = 355 113 / <

> func_in_func multi char var names = multi var avg2 char names avg2 avg2 <
> i_give_multiple_things = 100 200 <
> useless_thing input = input 3 / 3 * <
