 Anything not inside of the macro starter text and the macro ending text is ignored
(in this case the start and ending texts are the greater and less than signs).

(macro start text) (macro name) (macro vars) = (macro body) (macro end text)
No spaces in macro name, but spaces to seperate the stuff and spaces in between vars and spaces inside the macro body.

> avg2 x y = x y + 2 / <
//
use this first one like:
1 5 avg2
and it becomes
1 5 + 2 /

Vars can be skipped (but the name and body should not be skipped).
> pi = 355 113 / <
> e = pi 4 pow pi 5 pow + 6 root <

> ln input = input e log <
> sqrt thingy = thingy 2 root <

> i_give_multiple_things = 100 200 <
> useless input = input 3 / 3 * <

> mag_and_angle_from_components x y = x 2 pow y 2 pow +  2 root y x atan2 <
> rad_to_deg rad = rad 180 PI / * <
> deg_to_rad deg = deg PI 180 / * <

> the_silly = 0.1 0.2 + simplify <
> ğŸ˜‚ ğŸ™‚ğŸ¤¥ = ğŸ™‚ğŸ¤¥ 100 * <

Recursion is not possible, as these aren't functions.
